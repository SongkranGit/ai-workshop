# MCP Setup Guide - Playwright Browser Automation

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows GitHub Copilot to interact with external tools and services. In this project, we've configured Playwright MCP for browser automation.

## Configuration

File: `.vscode/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- ‚úÖ Node.js and npm installed
- ‚úÖ npx available (comes with npm)

## How to Use

### Example 1: Check Website Contact Location

**Prompt:**
```
‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ Playwright MCP ‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏à‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏ö https://www.kbtg.tech/th/home ‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏ß‡πá‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏ã‡∏ï‡πå‡πÉ‡∏™‡πà Contact ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏π‡πà‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà Nonthaburi ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πà‡πÑ‡∏´‡∏°
```

**What it does:**
1. Opens browser via Playwright
2. Navigates to KBTG website
3. Finds contact/location information
4. Verifies if "Nonthaburi" is mentioned

### Example 2: Test Transfer API Swagger UI

**Prompt:**
```
‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ Playwright MCP ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î http://localhost:3000/swagger ‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏î‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏ö POST /api/transfers
```

**What it does:**
1. Opens Swagger UI in browser
2. Interacts with API documentation
3. Executes test requests
4. Validates responses

### Example 3: Automated Testing

**Prompt:**
```
‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ Playwright MCP ‡∏ó‡∏î‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤ homepage ‡πÇ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏î‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÉ‡∏ô 3 ‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏µ ‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤ "Transfer" ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏è
```

## Available MCP Commands

The Playwright MCP server provides tools for:

- üåê **Browser Navigation**: `playwright_navigate`
- üñ±Ô∏è **Element Interaction**: `playwright_click`, `playwright_fill`
- üì∏ **Screenshots**: `playwright_screenshot`
- ‚úÖ **Assertions**: Check text, attributes, visibility
- üîç **Element Selection**: By CSS, XPath, text content

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: MCP server not loading

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify npx is available
npx --version

# Test Playwright MCP manually
npx -y @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

### Issue: VS Code doesn't recognize MCP

**Solution:**
1. Restart VS Code
2. Check GitHub Copilot is enabled
3. Verify `.vscode/mcp.json` exists in workspace root

### Issue: Permission denied

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure npm global packages are accessible
npm config get prefix

# Update npm if needed
npm install -g npm@latest
```

## Verification Steps

1. ‚úÖ `.vscode/mcp.json` file exists
2. ‚úÖ npx command is available: `which npx`
3. ‚úÖ VS Code workspace opened at repository root
4. ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot extension active
5. ‚úÖ Try a simple Playwright prompt to test

## Example Output

When you ask Copilot to use Playwright MCP:

```
ü§ñ Using Playwright MCP to navigate to https://www.kbtg.tech/th/home...

‚úÖ Page loaded successfully
üìç Found contact section
üîç Searching for "Nonthaburi"...
‚úÖ Confirmed: Contact address is in Nonthaburi
```

## Notes

- MCP servers run locally via npx
- First run may take longer (npm package download)
- Browser sessions are temporary (closed after task)
- Playwright runs in headless mode by default
